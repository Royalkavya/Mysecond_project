# Web_Scraper_Flask_App_project
#1. Introduction

“ My mini project is a Web Scraper with Flask Web App.
It collects motivational quotes from a website and displays them beautifully in a webpage.”

#2. What Tools I Used

“I used Python, Flask, BeautifulSoup, HTML, CSS, and JSON for this project.”

#3. How It Works

“I wrote a scraper.py file that uses the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to scrape quotes
 and authors from quotes.toscrape.com.
Then, I store the collected data into a file called scraped_data.json inside a folder named data.
I used exist_ok=True to make sure it doesn't give an error if the folder already exists.”

#4. Flask App

“Next, I created a Flask app using app.py, where I read the JSON data and send 
it to an HTML template using Jinja2.
In the index.html file, I used a for-loop to display each quote and author in a nice layout.”

#5. Styling

“I used a style.css file to make the page look neat — using background color, quote boxes, 
center alignment, shadows, and spacing.”

#6. Final Output

“Finally, I ran the Flask app locally and opened it in the browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000 to 
view the quotes on a styled web page.”

#7. What I Learned

“From this project, I learned how web scraping works, how to handle data with JSON, and how 
to create a small full-stack Python web app using Flask.”
